	El Nido is situated in Bacuit Bay and covers a land area of 465.1 square kilometres (179.6 sq mi).[6][7] It is in the northernmost tip of mainland Palawan and is bordered by the Linapacan Strait in the north, the Sulu Sea in the east, and the South China Sea in the west. El Nido includes 45 islands and islets,[5] each with its own unique geological formations. The highest peak is at Cadlao Island, towering up to 640 metres (2,100 ft) above sea level.[8]<br><br>
	
	Together with Sulu Archipelago, Sabah, and South China Sea, El Nido, being part of Palawan, is located in the tectonically active and seismically active Sunda Plate,[9] a plate that is entirely separate from the Philippine Mobile Belt to which the rest of the Philippines belongs. The Permian to Paleogene rocks and limestone cliffs of El Nido are similar to those that can be found in Ha Long Bay in Vietnam, Guilin in China, as well as Krabi in Thailand, all of which are part of the Sunda Plate.<br><br>
	
	El Nido is politically subdivided into eighteen barangays. Four of which are situated in the Población (town proper), and are also known by their respective zones.
